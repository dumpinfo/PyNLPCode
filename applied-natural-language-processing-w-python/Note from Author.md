#This repository contains all of the code for the book "Applied Natural Language Processing Using Python" 
Before utilizing any of the code in this repository, users should download all of the packages listed 
in the requirements.txt file, located under the "applied_nlp_python" directory. After all of these packages 
are downloaded, the main consideration should be reading the text alongside utilizng the code. Readers 
should be familiar with relative imports in addition to the general principles of machine learning and 
data science before tackling this text. If not, it is not recommended that they read this book 

#Disclamer: All of the code listed here is intended for academic purposes. Readers should not expect the 
usage of this code in commercial applications to results in 1:1 performance with respect to accuracy
and stability when utilizing differing datasets. However, should one feel compelled, they are encouraged
to apply the same techniques described in this book to their relative work environments 

#Overview: Each chapter contains code in the corresponding directory. Most of this code is intended to be 
walked through with each example, however readers can execute specific functions and expect the same, 
or similar, outputs. In some cases, there might be slight discrepencies with accuracy, but nothing should 
be drastically different. If so, please feel free to contact the author through the github page
